        <h2>About </h2>
        <p>The NWU-Lekwena Radar and The NWU-WRF is a test bed for students to learn and develop creative solutions related to weather forecasting and now-casting.</p>
        <p>“The idea was to take the old piece of technology and in the process of getting this thing to work upgrade it with the latest technologies and then in doing so we give students access to this process of capacity building.  And now today we sit with instrument that can give us real time weather information and not quite at the same level as some of the fancy radars that the South African Weather service has,” said the university’s Dr Roelof Burger</p>
